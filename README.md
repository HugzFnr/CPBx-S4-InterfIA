# InterfIA

Drawing game with some basic functions and with big pixels. In a limited time, you have to exactly copy a maximum of models (left side) on your grid (right side).

There are a total of 36 models, 18 in each streak (odd and even, you can activate one or another in the parameters file). 

You can play with the adaptative GUI, which are shortcuts appearing on the middle and updating based on your most used functions, or not, depending on the parameters file.

### Context

This project was made by Alice DRAILLARD and Hugo FOURNIER for our CPBx 2nd year project (from January to April 2018)) with the aim of learning User Centered Design and to experiment about light AI elements to help Human Computer Interaction.

The results weren't significative with only 13 testers and small differences.
